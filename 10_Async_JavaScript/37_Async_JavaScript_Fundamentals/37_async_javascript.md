# Asynchronous JavaScript Fundamentals üöÄüî•

- JavaScript is a Synchronous Language by default but we can modify it to Async. Line by Line Code is Executed.
- JavaScript is a Single threaded Language.

### Execution Context

- Execute one line of code at a time.
- Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing.

3.Memory Heap --> // - Memory Creation Phase (Creation Phase) --> Space is allocated to declared variables and can't execute here.
4.Call Stack
